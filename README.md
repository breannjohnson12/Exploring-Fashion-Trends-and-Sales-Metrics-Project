## üõçÔ∏è Exploring-Fashion-Trends-and-Sales-Metrics-Project

* This project analyzes a fashion retail dataset spanning 2018-2022 to uncover key business insights and consumer behavior patterns in the e-commerce fashion industry.
* This dataset captures the essence of fashion-related data over the span of 2018 to 2022. It contains entries for various fashion products, with details about their gender preference, category, pattern, color, age group target, seasonal preference, material, price, sales count, reviews, ratings, and more.
* I approached this project by using the data analysis cycle consisting of:
  * Forming/Asking Questions
  * Data Wrangling
  * Data Cleaning
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Data Visualization
  * Drawing Conclusions/Data Interpretation

 **Through my analysis I answered the following questions:**

 * What products sell the most and least?
 * What are the top-selling fashion categories in each season?
 * How do different materials perform across seasons?
 * What is the relationship between wishlist additions and actual purchases?
 * What percentage of customers add products to their wish list but do not purchase them?
 * Which materials are most preferred by customers in each age group?
 * What is the correlation between average rating and sales count? Do highly-rated products sell better?
 * Which brands maintain the highest average ratings?
 * Which brands have the highest total revenue, and how has their performance changed over time?
 * Are certain products more likely to be out of stock in specific seasons?
 * Which brands have the highest total revenue, and how has their performance changed over time?
 * What are the most popular colors and patterns in fashion trends from 2018-2022?
