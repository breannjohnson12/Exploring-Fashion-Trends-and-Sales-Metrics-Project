## üéß Spotify-Listening-History-Analysis

*This project analyzes personal Spotify listening history to uncover listening patterns, favorite artists, and music consumption habits. Using Python and data analysis libraries, it provides insights into music listening behavior over time.

*The dataset I used is a Spotify listening history dataset, containing information about tracks played, timestamps, play durations, platforms, and user behaviors (e.g., shuffle, skipped, reasons for starting/ending tracks). 
* I approached this project by using the data analysis cycle consisting of:
  * Forming/Asking Questions
  * Data Wrangling
  * Data Cleaning
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Data Visualization
  * Drawing Conclusions/Data Interpretation

 **Through my analysis I answered the following questions:**

 * How does listening behavior change over different times of the day, days of the week, or months?
 * Are there peaks in streaming activity (e.g., morning vs. evening listening)?
 * Which tracks have the longest average play duration?
 * Who are the top artists based on frequency of plays?
 * Does the listening behavior differ across different platforms (if available) such as the web player versus mobile?
 * What is the distribution of play durations in minutes, and are there outliers or tracks with unusually low or high play durations?
 * Is there a relationship between play duration and whether a track was skipped?
 * Which albums have the highest engagement, and does the context of play (e.g., autoplay vs. curated selection) vary by album?
 * How often do users skip tracks, and are there patterns in the songs that tend to be skipped?
